# Sorting Hat [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/daa1923d-e2f4-4002-8ad7-b79b6e8f1c98/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sorting-hat-hld/deploys)

The Sorting Hat allows the user to submit any name of their choosing and have that person randomly sorted into one of four Hogwarts houses. They are also able to expel students and have them join Voldemort's army. This app is created with mobile users in mind, and thus has been designed responsively.

## Get Started <!-- OPTIONAL, but doesn't hurt -->


## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The user of this app is likely in need of randomly assigning themselves, or a group of people, into teams. They, or their party, would be fans of Harry Potter and enjoy the process of assigning the teams with a Wizarding World theme. 

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When the "Sort Me!" button on the Welcome Card is clicked a form will populate.
- The form requires a text input, and when "Submit" button is clicked a student card will be created.
- Student cards feature the name of the student and the Hogwarts house they are randomly sorted into. The card also displays the corresponding crest of the assigned house.
- When the "Expel" button is clicked the student card is removed and a new card appears informing the user that the student has joined Voldemort's Army.
